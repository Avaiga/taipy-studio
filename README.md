# Taipy Studio

Taipy Studio is ultimately an application that allows for creating Taipy applications
reducing the code that needs to be manually created.

This application builder comes with predefined features that greatly accelerate
the development of applications that rely on Taipy Core.

Taipy Studio depends on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which provides a
full development environment, including state-of-the-art support for the Python programming
language. The Taipy-specific functionality is provided as a Visual Studio Code extension,
which this repository holds the source code.<br/>
